# 🌙 Doomsday Signs: An Islamic Perspective

## 💭 Personal Inspiration

Since childhood, the signs of the Day of Judgment have fascinated me. Like many Muslims, I often find myself wondering:

*"Have some signs already passed without us realizing? Are we witnessing them right now? What form will the remaining signs take?"*

These questions led me to create this project. I remember the first time I heard about the signs - some had already occurred, others were yet to come. I found myself constantly thinking about how these prophecies would manifest in our modern world.

The idea of Dajjal particularly intrigues me (may Allah protect us from his fitnah). The hadith mentions that he could take the form of someone you know - a concept that feels especially relevant in our age of deepfakes and AI. (Remember: Surat Al-Kahf is our protection!)

I'm sharing these thoughts because I know I'm not alone. Many of us contemplate these signs, trying to understand their meaning in our contemporary world. Whether it's the appearance of the Dabbah or the emergence of Yajuj and Majuj, these prophecies spark endless contemplation.
